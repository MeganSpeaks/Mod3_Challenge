# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recived.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate used.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data sources: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1 Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette

 ## Challenge Overview
 I reformatted code from the module to provide county data in addition to the candidate data already gathered.
 This script could be used for any election regardless of how many candidates or counties there are.  Other fields could be added as well, like political party. You would just need additional variables and conditional statements similar to the ones I created.
 
 ## Challenge Summary
To sumarize, Diana Degette won the election, and Denver county made up the majority of the voter turnout for this election.  The populations of those counties would be another factor that could provide more clarity as to voter patterns.
